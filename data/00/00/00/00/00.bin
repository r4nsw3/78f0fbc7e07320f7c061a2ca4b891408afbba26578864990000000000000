  |   Smash, clobber and bash the murderous legends of Slavic mythology     |
  |   in this darkly funny action role-playing game that changes every      |
  |   time you play. Play as Ivan, a one-handed blacksmith with             |
  |   incredibly bad luck, who must take on the impossible tasks given to   |
  |   him by the tzar. All the while the mysterious witch, Baba Yaga,       |
  |   watches over Ivan's fate.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The world of Yaga is a world steeped in Slavic folklore and ancient   |
  |   Pagan beliefs. Featuring a head-bobbing Romanian hip-hop soundtrack   |
  |   from Subcarpa»õi and striking, hand-drawn 2D artwork. Yaga is an       |
  |   authentic love letter to childhood fables from Romanian indie         |
  |   developer, Breadcrumbs Interactive.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Bludgeon the ancient monsters of Slavic folklore using a vast       |
  |     arsenal of hammers and tools forged by Ivan's own hands             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Your actions change Ivan's story, his reputation, and the           |
  |     upgrades he can choose                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Experiment in the deep forging system to make weapons like          |
  |     teleporting lightning hammers and hookshot pitchforks               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Explore the combinations of talismans, magic items, blessings,      |
  |     perks, and curses to fundamentally change how Ivan plays            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Multiple endings, multiple ways of solving encounters, procedural   |
  |     map, lots of characters to encounter, and hidden secrets mean       |
  |     Yaga is meant to be played over and over again                      |
  |                                                                         |
